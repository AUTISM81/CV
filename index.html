        <h3>Personal Work Experience</h3>
        <p>During these last two summers, I have been working a lot during the summers to earn money. During these summers I have worked as a janitor and at a grocery store called Ica. These last two summers have helped me learn that it is very important with good communication at workplaces so that everything is as effective as it can be. </p>

        <p>I have been going from seventh to ninth grade at the International English School. That is a school in which half of the education is in English. I am currently studying computer science and programming at Nordiska Tekniska Institutet. I wish to go to college and keep on studying more with programming.</p>

        <h3>Career Objectives</h3>
        <p>In the near future, I wish to be working with computers and programming. I would like to be having a stable job that I like and I will always be striving for more salary.</p>
